# Ne10_zynq_libs
It's a fork of the Ne10 project. They are the Ne10 libraries to be used with Xilinx Zynq in baremetal. In principle they could be used in any ARM in baremetal.

In order to compile the libraries it is necessary:
--- CentOS 7
--- cmake version 2.8.12.2
--- gcc-arm-none-eabi-linux (ver. 2018 or upper)
--- Vivado Design Suite (optional)
